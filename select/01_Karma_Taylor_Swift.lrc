[00:11.05] You're talking shit for the hell of it
[00:13.85] Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
[00:16.58] You're terrified to look down
[00:21.72] 'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
[00:24.42] Of everyone you burned just to get there
[00:27.23] It's coming back around
[00:38.73] 
[00:31.78] And I keep my side of the street clean
[00:37.43] You wouldn't know what I mean
[00:51.93] 
[00:42.40] 'Cause karma is my boyfriend
[00:44.72] Karma is a god
[00:46.03] Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
[00:49.38] Karma's a relaxing thought
[00:51.47] Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
[00:53.85] Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
[00:56.79] Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
[00:59.43] Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
[01:02.07] Me and karma vibe like that
[01:15.57] 
[01:04.66] Spider-boy, king of thieves
[01:07.35] Weave your little webs of opacity
[01:09.93] My pennies made your crown
[01:15.36] Trick me once, trick me twice
[01:18.05] Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
[01:20.40] It's coming back around
[01:31.90] 
[01:24.96] And I keep my side of the street clean
[01:30.57] You wouldn't know what I mean
[01:45.07]

[01:52.59] Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
[01:55.49] Me and karma vibe like that
[02:08.99] 
[01:58.09] Ask me what I learned from all those years
[02:00.52] Ask me what I earned from all those tears
[02:03.43] Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
[02:06.68] (I'm still, I'm still here)
[02:20.18] 
[02:10.45] 'Cause karma is the thunder
[02:12.84] Rattling your ground
[02:13.80] Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
[02:17.29] Karma's gonna track you down
[02:19.22] Step by step from town to town
[02:21.99] Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
[02:24.55] Karma takes all my friends to the summit
[02:27.92] Karma is the guy on the screen
[02:30.01] Coming straight home to me
[02:43.01] 
[02:31.93] 'Cause karma is my boyfriend (karma is my boyfriend)
